## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern software systems generate **continuous streams of time-series data** such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and logs. Detecting abnormal behavior in real time is critical for ensuring **system reliability, fault prevention, and performance stability**.

This project implements a **real-time anomaly detection system using LSTM Autoencoders** that:
- Learns **normal system behavior automatically**
- Detects **unknown and evolving anomalies**
- Operates on **live streaming data**

In addition, the project provides an **experimental deep-dive into optimization failures** in deep learning, including:
- Vanishing gradients  
- Null optimization  
- Poor convergence due to bad hyperparameters  

The project demonstrates **why optimization techniques are essential** for stable LSTM training in real-world systems.
